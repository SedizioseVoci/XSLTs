# XSLTs

Simple (primitive?) XSLTs for cleaning, transforming, and splicing up MODS, MADS, and other metadata files for Islandora ingest. Also included is an adapted XSLT for transforming MODS to DC OAI for DPLA Islandora harvests and a stylesheet (very much a work in progress) for converting Springer A++ monograph metadata into simple MODS records.
