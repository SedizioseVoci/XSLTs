# XSLTs

Simple (primitive?) XSLTs for cleaning, transforming, and splicing up MODS, MADS, and other metadata files for Islandora ingest. Also included is an adapted XSLT for transforming MODS to DC OAI for DPLA Islandora harvests and two stylesheets for remediating local ProQuest ETD data (replacing ProQuest keywords with FAST topical and geographical subject terms, correcting capitalization problems with student-supplied keywords, removing duplicate subject terms, and a few other things).
